# CS1501
CS1501 (Algorithm Implementation) in Spring 2017 at the University of Pittsburgh

This class was taking as a writing-intensive requirement, hence the four writing assignments in this repository.

Project 1 - Exhaustive Search/Pruning of Passwords in a Dictionary
    1. Used a De La Brandais Trie (DLB) to implement a symbol
    1. When the user feeds in a password, they will be informed if it's valid or invalid
        1. If it's invalid, 10 alternative passwords that match it the closest will be provided
Project 2 - LZW Compression
    1. Implemented LZW Compression (lossless method) to compress files
        1. Compression time differs based on the method being used (provided in project description)
            and the contents of the file given.
Project 3 - Car Database with Priority Queues
    1. Implemented a Min Heap that stored information about cars in a Database
Project 4 - Network/Latency with Graph Algorithms
    1. Provides statistics for a user-provided graph such as:
        1. Lowest latency path (shortest weighted path)
        1. Minimum spanning trees
        1. Connectivity by wire type
        1. Maximum bandwidth path (max flow)
        1. Articulation points
Project 5 - RSA Encryption
    1. Demonstrated RSA encryption for signing and verification of files
            1. This uses public and private keys to ensure correct users are viewing/being sent information from verified users

# CS1501
CS1501 (Algorithm Implementation) in Spring 2017 at the University of Pittsburgh

This class was taking as a writing-intensive requirement, hence the four writing assignments in this repository.

Project 1 - Exhaustive Search/Pruning of Passwords in a Dictionary
    * Used a De La Brandais Trie (DLB) to implement a symbol
    * When the user feeds in a password, they will be informed if it's valid or invalid
        * If it's invalid, 10 alternative passwords that match it the closest will be provided
Project 2 - LZW Compression
    * Implemented LZW Compression (lossless method) to compress files
        * Compression time differs based on the method being used (provided in project description)
            and the contents of the file given.
Project 3 - Car Database with Priority Queues
    * Implemented a Min Heap that stored information about cars in a Database
Project 4 - Network/Latency with Graph Algorithms
    * Provides statistics for a user-provided graph such as:
        * Lowest latency path (shortest weighted path)
        * Minimum spanning trees
        * Connectivity by wire type
        * Maximum bandwidth path (max flow)
        * Articulation points
Project 5 - RSA Encryption
    * Demonstrated RSA encryption for signing and verification of files
            * This uses public and private keys to ensure correct users are viewing/being sent information from verified users

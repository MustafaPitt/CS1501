Additional comments to the grader:
All of these programs were ran on a 64-bit machine with Windows 10 as the OS.  Keep this in mind when 
checking file sizes, as OSX's file system uses 1000B = 1KB, whereas Windows uses 1024B = 1KB, causing a
slight difference depending on the machine these are ran on.
